In my professional background as a DevOps engineer, I observed the importance and hardships of ensuring services which are stable, scalable and of high quality. Enterprises are rapidly moving into the cloud-native space, utilizing microservice architectures to enhance stability and scalability. Therefore modern systems are far more complex, with many moving parts.

High quality is ensured through the pre-deployment unit, integration, system and acceptance testing, besides live monitoring of logs, metrics, traces and alerting. Most of the tools can only capture errors of granular level, and therefore incapable of representing overall user experience in a measurable form.

Selenium provides the toolset to implement system and acceptance level tests by imitating user behaviour. However, it can only be utilized in the pre-deployment testing phase, and current live production monitoring cannot effectively spot errors between system components.

My thesis project is about bringing selenium's capabilities to the live production cloud-native space and providing an easy-to-use instrument to integrate selenium testing into industry-standard monitoring/alerting chains by building a go-based Kubernetes operator which automates selenium test runs and aggregates the results in Prometheus format.
